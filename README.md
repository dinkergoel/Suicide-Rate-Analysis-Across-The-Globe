**Suicide Rate Analysis Across The Globe From 1990 to 2017**

The WHO estimates that almost 800,000 people die from suicide every year. That’s one person every 40 seconds. While recent rates show a decreasing trend for many nations, still it is an alarming issue among people. With the recent pandemic and other societal pressures, this dashboard can provide needful insights to help identify
groups that are more prone to such extreme steps, and adequate care/resources can be provided to help save precious lives.

The primary goal of this dashboard is to analyze patterns for suicide rates based on different age groups, gender, and geographic locations. Following visualizations are used:

**• Standard Visualizations:**

    • Stacked Area Chart (Suicide Prevalence By Age Group)
    • Line Chart (Comparison of M-F suicide rates over the years)
    • Scatter Chart (Suicide Prevalence By Gender)
    
**• Non-Standard Visualizations:**

    • Choropleth Map (Suicide Prevalence By Geographic location)
    • Parallel Coordinates Plot (Potential Factors Causing Suicides)
